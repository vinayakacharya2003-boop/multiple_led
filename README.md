Upon giving the power supply, all 8 LEDs should be OFF.

Now, press switch-1 on the Digital Keypad, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-1*

Press switch-2, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-2*

Press switch-3, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-3*

Press switch-4, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-4*

*pattern-1: The LEDs should glow from Left to Right and Right to left as explained in the assignment-1.

*pattern-2: The LEDs should glow from left to Right and switch off from left to right, no direction control/ direction change.
